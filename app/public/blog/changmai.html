          Hey guys, I was in Chiang Mai for 2 months and spent a great time there. I want to share what I did during my stay.
        </p>

      <!-- Why I was in Chiang Mai -->
      <section class="mb-8">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4" id="why-i-was-in-chiang-mai-">Why I was in Chiang Mai?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Right before arriving in Chiang Mai, I was in Australia. My visa was about to expire in 3 months, and I didn’t want to go back to Japan.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Pedro, a friend I met in Australia, told me, “South Asia, especially Thailand, is awesome. You should go there too.” 
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          I asked him, “Alright, but which area do you recommend? If I go, I’ll need a decent co-working space and a gym.” He replied, “Then go to Chiang Mai.”
        </p>

      <!-- Planning -->
      <section class="mb-8">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4" id="planning">Planning</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          My plan in Chiang Mai was to create one or two of my own products to add to my software engineering portfolio. I wanted to ensure I could get a job when I returned to Japan.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          I didn’t want to make a product just for my portfolio. Since building a product takes 2-5 months for me, I wanted to create something useful for myself, not just a project to show that I can code.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          I already had a product, <a href="http://travelpackhub.com" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">travelpackhub.com</a>, but it didn’t have active users. I wanted to build more interactive apps that engage users, which are more challenging and would enhance my coding skills.

      <!-- Hyperbolic Time Chamber -->
      <section class="mb-8">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4" id="hyperbolic-time-chamber">Hyperbolic Time Chamber</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          I called this 2 month trip “doing Hyperbolic Time Chamber but Chiang Mai.” My routine was simple: wake up, grab coffee, go to the gym, work at a co-working space, have dinner, and smoke weed with hostel mates. I repeated this every day without taking a break.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Staying busy gave me purpose. It’s good for mental health, as it helps avoid wasting energy on social media or other distractions.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Although the product I made didn’t make any money, I’m proud that I consistently worked on something every day.
